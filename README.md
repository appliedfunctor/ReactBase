# ReactBase

This is a base project using GULP for React and Scss development.

It uses the following:

gulp
gulp-sass
gulp-connect
gulp-open
browserify
vinyl-source-stream
gulp-concat
gulp-eslint
gulp-babel
bootstrap

This should provide a starting point for transpiling and bundling css / scss and js / jsx as well as 
launching a server and monitoring / reloading on changes.

The gulp execution task is 'run'. To execute, on the console, type:

gulp run
